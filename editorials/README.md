# Editorials Dataset

The Editorials Dataset can be found [HERE](https://webis.de/data/webis-editorial-quality-18.html). It has a link to the "Zenodo" platform, where you can download the files `corpus-webis-editorial-quality-18.json` and `corpus-webis-editorial-quality-18_annotators-personality-traits.csv`.

Additional features for the articles were collected from [this github page](https://github.com/webis-de/acl20-editorials-style-persuasive-effect/tree/master/data). The file you need is `articles_with_majority_adus.json`
